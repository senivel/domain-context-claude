# Session State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-17)

**Core value:** Developers can codify and maintain domain knowledge alongside code so AI assistants always have accurate business context
**Current focus:** Milestone v1.4 Documentation

## Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-03-17 — Milestone v1.4 started

## Accumulated Context

### From v1.3
- Single CommonJS file for installer — no benefit to module splitting
- isDcHook matches dc- substring in command strings
- Filter-then-append for idempotent hook merging
- node:test for test framework (built-in, no dependencies)
- INSTALL_MAP-driven symmetric install/uninstall
- commands/dc/ subdirectory removed entirely (dc-owned), parent dirs preserved

### From v1.2
- Sentinel pattern (<!-- prefix:start/end -->) reused for GSD bridge template
- GSD bridge template is static content only, no placeholders
- Batch write after full accept/reject loop (not incremental)
- 13-step scan-classify-propose-create pipeline for dc:extract

### From v1.1
- 3-second stdin timeout for hooks prevents UI error warnings
- globs: (not paths:) for rules due to Claude Code parser bug (GitHub #17204)
- Defense-in-depth: tool scoping via settings.json matcher AND in-hook allowlist
- Read-only domain validator agent — report-only, never modifies files

### From v1.0
- Template-first build order prevents circular deps
- Dual-location verified date (MANIFEST.md + inline comment)
- Per-group fix offers in validate for better UX
- AGENTS.md import check as warning (optional per spec)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
